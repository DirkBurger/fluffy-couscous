Genesis,1,1,Genesis 1:1,"The Bible and Proven Scientific Facts
The Bible does not claim to be a textbook of scientific knowledge. Its writers, however, did make accurate comments on matters that should interest scientists today. Here are some examples.
Age of the earth and the universe
Scientists estimate that the earth is about 4 billion years old and that the universe was born some 13 to 14 billion years ago. The Bible sets no date for the creation of the universe. In no place does it affirm that the earth is only a few thousand years old. The very first verse in the Bible reads: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” (Genesis 1:1) That general statement allows scientists to determine the age of the physical world according to sound scientific principles."
Malachi,3,10,Test Jehovah,"As a youth, you need to realize that even if you were to gain the approval of your peers, years from now most of them likely will not even remember your name. In contrast, when you resist peer pressure, Jehovah takes note of it, and he will never forget you or your faithfulness. He will “open to you . . . the floodgates of the heavens and actually empty out upon you a blessing until there is no more want.” (Mal. 3:10) Moreover, he generously supplies his holy spirit to make up for any lack you may now have. Yes, Jehovah can help you to resist pressure from your peers!"
Matthew,6,33,Put Kingdom Things First,"6 If we have sufficient food for many days, we can think of brothers who live in poverty or who are affected by disasters. We should not only pray for them but also act in harmony with our prayers. For example, we can share what we have with fellow worshippers in need. We can also regularly contribute to the worldwide work, knowing that such funds are used wisely.—1 John 3:17.
7 In referring to our daily bread, Jesus likely meant our immediate needs. Thus, he went on to show how God clothes the wildflowers, and then he said: “Will he not much rather clothe you, you with little faith? So never be anxious and say, . . . ‘What are we to wear?’” He concluded by repeating this important advice: “Never be anxious about the next day.” (Matt. 6:30-34) This shows that rather than be materialistic, we should be content with our basic daily needs. Such needs may include suitable accommodations, employment to provide for our family, and wisdom to cope with health concerns. If we were to pray only for such physical needs, however, it would indicate an imbalance. We have spiritual needs that are of much greater importance"
